		<p>
			<b>HTML</b> stands for <mark><b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b></mark>.It is launched in 1993.
		</P>
		<p>
			At its core, HTML is the <mark> standard markup language used to create web pages</mark>. Think of it as the <b>skeleton or the foundational structure of any   			website you visit</b>.Without HTML, there would be no text, no images, no videos, and no links on a web page â€“ just a blank screen
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's a breakdown of what that means:
			<ul>
				<li><b>HyperText: </b>This refers to the way web pages are linked together.<ins> The "hyper" part means it's not linear</ins>; you can jump from one page to 				another using hyperlinks (the clickable text or images that take you to a new page).</li>
				<li><b>Markup:</b> HTML uses "tags" to "mark up" or define the different parts of a web page. These tags tell the web browser how to display the content. 				For example, a tag might indicate that a piece of text is a heading, a paragraph, an image, or a link.</li>
				<li><b>Language:</b> It's a language that web browsers understand. When a browser receives an HTML file, it reads the HTML code and renders (displays) the 				content on your screen according to the instructions given by the tags.</li>
			</ul>
		</P><hr/>
		<p>
			<i><b>What HTML Does:</b></i><br>HTML is responsible for:
			<ol>
				<li><b>Structuring Content:</b>It defines the different sections of a web page, such as<ins> headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, and 						more</ins>.</li>
				<li><b>Embedding Media:</b> It allows you to embed images, audio, video, and other multimedia content into your web pages.</li>
				<li><b>Creating Links:</b> It provides the mechanism for creating hyperlinks that connect different web pages to each other (both within the same website 				and to external websites).</li>
				<li><b>Semantic Meaning:</b><mark> Modern HTML (HTML5)</mark> also introduces elements that add semantic meaning to content, helping both browsers and 					developers understand the purpose of different parts of a page.</li>
			</ol>
		</P><hr/>
		<p>
			<b>What HTML Doesn't Do (on its own):</b><br>It's important to understand that HTML is not a programming language. It doesn't perform <mark>logical operations, 				calculations, or dynamic interactions.</mark>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Styling:</b> <mark>HTML doesn't handle the visual presentation (colors, fonts, layout, spacing)</mark>. That's the job of CSS (Cascading Style 					Sheets).</li>
				<li><b>Interactivity:</b> HTML doesn't add dynamic behavior or interactivity (like animations, form validation, or fetching data from a server). That's 				where JavaScript comes in.</li>
			</ul>
		</P><hr/>
		<p>
			<i><b>In summary:</b></i><br>HTML is the<mark> fundamental building block of the web</mark>. It provides the content and structure, laying the groundwork upon which 			<mark>CSS adds style and JavaScript adds interactivity</mark>. If you're looking to build anything for the web, learning HTML is the very first and most crucial 			step
